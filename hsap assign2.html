        <h5>What is AI?</h5>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
            systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition
            and machine vis
            ion.As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and
            services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine
            learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine
            learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R,
            Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.</p>

        <h5>Differences between AI, machine learning and deep learning</h5>
        <p>AI, machine learning and deep learning are common terms in enterprise IT and sometimes used interchangeably,
            especially by companies in their marketing materials. But there are distinctions. The term AI, coined in the
            1950s, refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It covers an ever-changing set of
            capabilities as new technologies are developed. Technologies that come under the umbrella of AI include
            machine learning and deep learning.

            Machine learning enables software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being
            explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new
            output values. This approach became vastly more effective with the rise of large data sets to train on. Deep
            learning, a subset of machine learning, is based on our understanding of how the brain is structured. Deep
            learning's use of artificial neural network structure is the underpinning of recent advances in AI,
            including self-driving cars and ChatGPT.

    <section id="section-c">

        <div class="box1">Good at detail-oriented jobs. AI has proven to be just as good, if not better than doctors at
            diagnosing certain cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma</div>
        <div class="box2">Reduced time for data-heavy tasks. AI is widely used in data-heavy industries, including
            banking and securities, pharma and insurance, to reduce the time it takes to analyze big data sets.
            Financial services, for example, routinely use AI to process loan applications and detect fraud.</div>
        <div class="box1">Saves labor and increases productivity. An example here is the use of warehouse automation,
            which grew during the pandemic and is expected to increase with the integration of AI and machine learning.
